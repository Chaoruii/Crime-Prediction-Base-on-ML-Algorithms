# Project
All projects I have finished before
This describes our methods and results of the ML4VA project. In this project, we built a Machine Learning model for analyzing and predicting the crime in Virginia with the dataset from Virginia Beach. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to make meaningful contribution to the wellbeing of the state of Virginia and its residents, as a team. First, We clean out the crime dataset and collected other useful features like Economic data and Population data. With a discretized map, we record all the data related to the geographic and merge them with the crime instances. Then, We use a cluster model to find out the distribution patterns of these crimes. With these patterns, the citizens and government could get some insight of how to avoid or prevent crimes. Furthermore, we find out that the clusters have very different patterns in time distribution. To dig deep into the data, we apply ARIMA model to get time predictions
for crimes in each cluster. Since we did clustering before applying ARIMA, the result is not bad even compared with RNN models from other papers.
